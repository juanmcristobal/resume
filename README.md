## About me
I am a __Software Engineer__ and I have more than 10 years of experience in the development and management 
of projects. My strengths are backend development and data analysis, although I do very well in any development.
I have insatiable appetite for knowledge and am seeking a company where i can participate in highly advanced 
technology and contribute hands on experience to crafting clean and reusable code.

- I think about how data shapes software.
Thinking of scale comes naturally to me.
- I am organized and pay attention to detail.
- I am curious, passionate about learning and keep up with emerging technologies/industry trends to apply 
them to achieve high quality code.
- I am experienced in software development life cycle (SDLC) and agile/iterative methodologies.
- My developments offer a good performance, scalability and are easy to understand.
- Ability to find creative solutions to difficult problems
- Able to work both independently and as a part of a team.
